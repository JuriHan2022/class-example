<p><h1>
  Your eye, <ol> <li>first of all, would glide over the <em>grey</em> fitted carpet in the <em>narrow, long and high-ceilinged corridor</em>. Its walls would be cupboards, in <em>light-colored wood</em>, with fittings of <em>gleaming brass</em>. Three prints, depticting respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer named Ville-de-Montereau, and a Stephenson locomotive, would lead to a leather curtain hanging on <em>thick, black, grainy wooden</em> rings which would slide back at the merest touch. There, the carpet would give way to an almost <em>yellow woodblock</em> floor, partly covered by three <em>faded</em> rugs.</h1>

</p>
<p><h2>it would be a living room about <em>twenty-three feet long by ten feet wide.</em> <li>On the left, in a kind of recess, there would be a large sofa upholstered in <em>worn black leather</em> with <em>pale cherrywood bookcases</em> on either side, heaped with books in <em>untidy</em> piles above the sofa, a mariner’s chart would fil the whole length of that section of the wall. On the other side of a small low table, and beneath a <em>silk</em> prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, there would be another sofa, li>at right angles to the first, with a <em>light-brown velvet</em> covering; it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in <em>dark red</em> and providing rhee-display shelves for knick-knacks: agates and stone eggs, snuffboxes, candy boxes, jade ashtray, a mother-of-pearl oyster shell, a silver fob watch, a cut glass, a crystal pyramid, a miniature in an oval frame. Further on, beyond a padded door, there would be shelving on both sides of the corner, for caskets and for records, beside a closed gramophone of which only four machined-steel knobs would be visible, and above it, a print depicting The Great Parade of the Military Tattoo. Through the window, draped with white and <em>brown</em> curtains in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, you would glimpse a few trees, a tiny park abit of street. A rolltop desk littered with peppers and pen-holders would go with a small cane-seated chair. On a console table would be a telephone, a leather diary, a writing pad. <li>Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase supporting a large, cylindrical vase decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame, there would be  a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your <li>eye back to the leather curtain. </h2>
</p>
<p><h3>It would be all in browns, ochers, duns and yellows: a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calculated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be some striking, brighter splashes - a cushion in almost garish orange, a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes. During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. But in the winter, with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - the bookcase corner, the record shelves, the desk, the low table between the two settees, and the vague reflections in the mirror and the large expanses in shadow, whence all the things would gleam - the polished wood, the rich eheavy silks the cut glass , the softened leather - it would be a haven of peace, a land of happiness.</h3>
</p>
<p><h4><li>The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. An English doubled bed would fill the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, there would betall and narrow sets of shelves holding a few books, to be read and read again, photograph albums, packs of cards, pots, necklaces, paaste jewellery. To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of wood and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in thin-striped grey silk and a dressing table. Through a half-open door giving on to a bathroom you would glimpse thick bathrobes, swan-neck taps in solid brass, a large adjustable mirror, a pair of cutthroat razors and their green leather sheaths, bottles, horn-handled brushes, sponges. The bedroom walls would be prepared with chintz; the bedspread would be a tartan blanket. A bedside table, with an openwork copper band running round three of its sides, would support a silver candlestick.</h4>
</p>
<p><h5><li>The second door would reveal a study. From top to bottom the walls would be lined with books and periodicals with, here and there, so as to break the continuity of bindings and jackets, a number of prints, drawings, and photographs - Antonello da Messina’s Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of Saint George, one of Piranesi’s dungneous, a portrait by Ingres, a little pen -and-ink landscape by Klee, a sepia-tint photograph of Renan in his room a the College de France, a Steinberg department store, Cranch’s Melanchthon-pinned to wooden panels set into shelving. Slightly to the left of the window at a shallow angle would be a long country table covered with a large red blotter wooden boxes, falte pen-holders and pots of all kinds would hold pencils, paper-clips, staples, large and small. Behind the desk, half-hidden by the red curtain at the window, would be an oiled -wood ladder which could slide on a brass rail all the way round the room. </h5></p>
<p><h6>There, life would be easy, simple, All the servitudes, all the problems brought by material existence would find a natural solution. </h6></p>
